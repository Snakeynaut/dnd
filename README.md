<p align="center">Welcome to my Dungeons and Dragons Repository! This repository serves as a collection of notes, adventures, and various items related to the world of Dungeons and Dragons (D&D). I am mostly using this as a synchronized store for various documents that I written for my own games.</p>

## Introduction

D&D is a tabletop role-playing game where players embark on epic adventures in a fantasy world. This repository aims to provide a centralized space for the community to share and collaborate on their D&D creations, including campaign notes, character backstories, adventure modules, custom rules, and more.

I also personally use [Owlbear Rodeo](https://www.owlbear.app/) as my choice of digital tabletop tool for various table top games. It's lightweight and very easy to use with relatively no learning curve. It requires players **to not register for the site** (which is my favorite feature). By combining the resources in this repository with the features of Owlbear Rodeo, you can bring up the adventures quickly. Import adventure modules from this repository into Owlbear Rodeo to access them during your sessions.

### Conventions
#### Running the Adventures
To run adventures in this repo, you need the D&D 5E core rulebooks: Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual. The Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide is helpful, but not necessary.

>Text that appears in a quotes like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.

The Monster Manual contains stat blocks for most of the creatures found in this adventure. All the necessary stat blocks are either included in the book, the appendices, or a linked resource. When a creature's name appears in **bold type**, that's a visual cue for you to look up the creature's stat block..

Spells and equipment mentioned in the adventure are described in the Player's Handbook. Magic items are described in the Dungeon Master's Guide.
